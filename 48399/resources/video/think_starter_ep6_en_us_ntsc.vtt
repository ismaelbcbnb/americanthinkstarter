00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, Ruby. I’m glad you’re here.

2
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, it’s you.

3
00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I know you’re angry with me,
but I think I can change that.

4
00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh? How, Dan?

5
00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:32.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, I searched for
“fear of spiders” online.

6
00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
There’s a website all about it.

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
They have a really good way
to help people who are afraid of spiders.

8
00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Can I show you?

9
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, OK. What is it?

10
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:50.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK, so the idea is to look
at a spider in a very safe way.

11
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So we start with a picture. Like this.

12
00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It's OK. It’s just a picture.
It can’t hurt you.

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Now, just look at it.

14
00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:15.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK. That’s OK. It’s just a picture.

15
00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:20.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, this is OK. I feel fine.

16
00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:28.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Excellent. Now, next step. I put
the picture of the spider in your hand.

17
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:35.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s OK. It’s just a picture.
Now give me your hand.

18
00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:43.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I just lay the picture
of the spider in your hand.

19
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
There, that’s not so bad, is it?

20
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, you’re right. That’s not so bad.

21
00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:55.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s just a picture. It’s just a picture.

22
00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:59.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Good, good.
Now let’s make it move a little.

23
00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:03.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Oh, no!
- It’s OK, Ruby. It’s just a picture.

24
00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It can’t hurt you.

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Excellent! That’s really good.
It's a really great start.

26
00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:21.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Now, we do this every day
until you don’t feel afraid anymore.

27
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah! Look at me!
I think this idea works, Dan.

28
00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I have a spider in my hand,
and I’m not afraid!

29
00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This is great. Thank you, Dan!

30
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
You’re welcome.
What’s that?

31
00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:44.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Dan! I hate you. You’re such a jerk!

32
00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:49.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, come on, Ruby!
Ruby, it's a joke. I'm sorry.

33
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It's a friendly joke.

34
00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:55.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Friendly?
You are NOT my friend.

35
00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Friends are nice to each other!

36
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, come on, Ruby.

37
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I don’t understand, Ellie.

38
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Dan is my friend.
Why is he so mean to me?

39
00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:14.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
He just did something stupid, that’s all.
To him, it was just a little joke.

40
00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:18.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, maybe you’re right.
And he said sorry.

41
00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:22.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes, but maybe that isn’t good enough.

42
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I have an idea for a joke 
<i>we</i> can play on <i>him!</i>

43
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:30.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
A joke on Dan? What do you mean?

44
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:35.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, I know something about Dan ...

45
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Really?!
- Yes! So maybe we ...

46
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:47.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- What do you think?
- Oh, Ellie! That’s a great idea!

47
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Let’s do it!

48
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:57.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So, can you do it, Jason?

49
00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:01.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sure. I’ll ask my science teacher,
Mr. Leonard, but I think I can do that.

50
00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- No problem, Ellie.
- Great! Thanks, Jason.

51
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
See you tomorrow.

52
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Hey, Dan. How’s it going?
- Hi, Ellie. Good.

53
00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
You know Jason, right?

54
00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:27.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Sure. Hi, Jason.
- Hi, Dan. What’s that?

55
00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:32.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, it’s just some homework I'm doing
for my next class. What’s in the box?

56
00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:35.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This? Well, it’s a hobby of mine.

57
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Mr. Leonard asked me to bring it in

58
00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:39.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
to show the science class
this afternoon.

59
00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:43.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah. Do you want to see?

60
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sure.

61
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:51.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So, uh, Dan,
what homework is that?

62
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.833 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Just some math.

63
00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I don’t understand it very well,
so I want to look at it again before class.

64
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, that’s nice.

65
00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Here it is.

66
00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:10.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Woah!!!

67
00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Nice one. Thanks, Jason!

68
00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:20.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
That was great! See you, Dan.
Bye, Ellie.

69
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:26.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Cool snake, huh?!

70
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:35.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ruby, I’m sorry. Honestly.

71
00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:38.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Thanks, Dan. It’s OK.

72
00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:42.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It <i>is</i> silly to be afraid of spiders.
You’re right.

73
00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:44.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And I heard about this morning.
With Jason.

74
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- You did?
- Uh huh. So now you know what it’s like.

75
00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:52.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, I do. That’s why I’m sorry.

76
00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:56.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So, tell me what happened?
I want to know!

77
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
You tell him, Dan.

78
00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:02.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, a long time ago,
I told Ellie that I’m afraid of snakes.

79
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:06.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And Ellie’s friend Jason ...
well, he loves snakes,

80
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
and he has a pet snake at home.

81
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK! So you ....

82
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:15.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
... asked Jason to bring his snake
to school. And when Dan saw it ...

83
00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
... I got scared,
just like Ruby with the spider.

84
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:20.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ha! So you learned your lesson.

85
00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:23.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
That everybody's afraid
of something, and it <i>isn’t</i> funny!

86
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So, Tom. What are you afraid of?

87
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:32.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Me? Nothing, really.
But now, I think I’m afraid of Ellie!
