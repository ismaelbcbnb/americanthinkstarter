Thanks again for helping us, Ruby.

2
00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
That’s OK. But I’m really nervous.

3
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s a small part.
Here are your lines. There aren’t many.

4
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:40.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
There are lots of lines. This is terrible!
The play is only three days from now!

5
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Don’t worry. We’re here to help you.

6
00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Let’s practice every day.

7
00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:46.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Look ... it isn't that bad ...

8
00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:49.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Action!

9
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>Stop! Who are you?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

10
00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>I’m just a girl from the ... from the ...</i>

11
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
village.

12
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:11.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>...village. I want to speak to... to...</i>
<i>with... uh...</i>

13
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
the king.

14
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>king. I want to speak to the king.</i>

15
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This is no good. I’m terrible.
I really don’t think I can do this.

16
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
You aren’t terrible. You’re great.
And you <i>can</i> do it.

17
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I don’t know.

18
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Don’t worry. Let’s start again.

19
00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:42.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>...speak to the king. My name is May,</i>
<i>and I want you to ask me...</i>

20
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>I want you... me...</i>

21
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, I don’t know!
This is bad. And I’m terrible!

22
00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:58.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, you aren’t.
You’re just nervous. Relax!

23
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I just can’t get it right.

24
00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:05.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on, Ruby. You can do this.

25
00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:09.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I’m just so nervous.

26
00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:13.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I know, but it’s OK. Really.

27
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Now, let’s start again.

28
00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And action!

29
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:32.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Here I am.

30
00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:37.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, Ruby. It’s your big day.
Are you excited?

31
00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:40.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, just nervous. But let’s do it.

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Thanks, Ruby. You really are the best.

33
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, guys.

34
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Why are you so happy?

35
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I have good news for you, Ruby.

36
00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
For me? What is it?

37
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:55.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- It’s Anna Williams. She’s better.
- Better?

38
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:59.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes. She isn’t sick now.
And she wants to be in the play.

39
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Really?
- Yes, really. Isn’t that great?!

40
00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:06.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No!

41
00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:12.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, that isn’t great!

42
00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:14.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
What? You aren’t happy about this?

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, I’m not!

44
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
But, you’re so nervous and ...

45
00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:26.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes, but, well, it’s my part now.
I’m in the play, not Anna.

46
00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:32.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sorry, Ruby,
but it really is<i> her</i> part, so...

47
00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:36.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on, Ruby. Let’s go and watch
the play. We can sit together.

48
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
But I know all the lines. Listen!

49
00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:45.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>I’m just a girl from the village.</i>
<i>I want to speak to the king!</i>

50
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:51.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
See! I know it! It’s my part!
I’m the girl from the village!

51
00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Guys? Hey, guys! Wait for me!
