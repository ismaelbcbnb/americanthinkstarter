I’m really sorry.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- What about?
- My dad.

3
00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Why?
- He’s so embarrassing.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
“I know a great song called <i>Ruby.</i>
Where’s my guitar?”

5
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This is my room.

6
00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Wow. What a nice poster.

7
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Do you like auto racing?
- Not really. I just like this race car.

8
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I like it, too.

9
00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:52.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ah, I know what I like.

10
00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Careful! That chair is ... broken.

11
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Too late!

12
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:10.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Wow. I like your backyard.
It’s so big.

13
00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:14.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, it isn’t all our yard.
This part is ours,

14
00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:19.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
but that part is from the house next door.
Our yard is really small.

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, maybe, but your house is big.
Can we see it?

16
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sure, come on.

17
00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And this is my sister’s room.

18
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s nice. I really like it.

19
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And this is the game room.

20
00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:05.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Table tennis! Cool!

21
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, let’s play sometime.

22
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sure. We can do that.

23
00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:22.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And here’s the living room.

24
00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Wow! That’s a big TV!

25
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, it’s great.

26
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Look at all those DVDs!

27
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I really like your music.

28
00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Wow! Coldplay. They’re awesome.

29
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ed Sheeran! I love his music.

30
00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And there’s Lorde. She’s great.

31
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And Lil Wayne!
You have rap music, too. Cool!

32
00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This is great music, Tom.

33
00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:03.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
But why do you buy CDs?
You can just download all of this.

34
00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:09.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, it’s not my music.
It’s my dad’s. He likes to listen to CDs.

35
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Your dad’s? Really?

36
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Is your dad a musi...

37
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ah, there you are. Good.
Now, sit down, sit down.

38
00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:18.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Dad, please.

39
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Don’t worry. Only one song.

40
00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:25.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sit down, please,
I want you all to listen.

41
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Dad, please.

42
00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Let’s listen, Tom.

43
00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:33.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby,…</i>

44
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>Do you, do you, do you, do you,…</i>

45
00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:43.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>Know what you’re doing, doing to me?</i>

46
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Tom, your dad is really cool.
- Really?

47
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!</i>

48
00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, he is.
