- Why doesn’t it work?
- Do you want some help?

2
00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:20.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, no, no thanks. I can do it.

3
00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:23.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I know how to do this.
Just wait a minute.

4
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:54.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So, Tom? Is the TV working?

5
00:00:54.083 --> 00:01:00.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Maybe "Input,"
then "TV," then "Cable."

6
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No.

7
00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Why don't we play table tennis
for a while?

8
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Where is it, Tom?

9
00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:12.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Maybe it’s the cable service.
Maybe the cable is out.

10
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s in the game room.

11
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on, you two.
Let’s go and play!

12
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.833 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Tom, call us when the TV’s OK.

13
00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:22.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sure, OK.

14
00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK, Ruby to serve.

15
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:54.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- I’m not very good at this.
- No, you're not.

16
00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:03.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Yay! I win!
- Yes.

17
00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Aha!

18
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, come on!

19
00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:13.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
What’s wrong with this thing?

20
00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:17.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

21
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Five minutes, no problem.

22
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Any news?
- A few more minutes, he says.

23
00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.833 A:middle L:100% S:80%
How about another game?

24
00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:40.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I don’t want to play
table tennis anymore!

25
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:43.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hey - there’s a basketball hoop outside.
Let’s play some basketball.

26
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah.

27
00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, yeah,
I need help with my TV.

28
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.083 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s... Yes, I can hold...

29
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:14.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah!

30
00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:01.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK, last one.

31
00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes! Thank you! Thank you so much!

32
00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:16.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hey, guys! It’s fixed! The TV’s fixed!

33
00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Let’s go, guys! The TV is ...

34
00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:33.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
There you are.

35
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:35.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- The TV is fixed.
- Finally!

36
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:39.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on, then!
Let’s go watch the game!

37
00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
See? It’s OK again.

38
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
What a game, what a game!

39
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And that’s it!
Thank you for watching. Goodbye!

40
00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
What?

41
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, no!

42
00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
It’s over? The game is finished?

43
00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:08.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Who won? Was it the U.S. or Brazil?

44
00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:17.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Sorry, guys. Uh ... how about
a nice game of table tennis?

45
00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, Tom!
