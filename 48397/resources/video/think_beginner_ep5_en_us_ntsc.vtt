There’s nothing to eat in this house.

2
00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:26.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
You’re right.
We really need to go shopping soon.

3
00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Soon? That’s no good.
We need food now.

4
00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.833 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Don’t worry. Where’s the phone?

5
00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
The phone?
What do you want the phone for?

6
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Wait and see.

00:00:57.042 --> 00:01:02.208 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hello?
Is this Andy’s Chicken House?

8
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:06.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes,
I’d like to order some chicken.

9
00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:08.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Can you get the door?

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes, I would like twelve pieces...

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi.

12
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Hey.
- Hi, Dan. Hi, Tom.

13
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.625 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, guys.

14
00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:26.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Mmm, something smells good.
Is that for us?

15
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Um, well, ...

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I’m really hungry.

17
00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:37.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, it isn’t ready yet.

18
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.917 A:middle L:100% S:80%
We can wait in the living room.

19
00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:45.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
No, no. We can wait in the kitchen.
It’s OK.

20
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yeah, we can watch you cook.

21
00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:59.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
So when is dinner ready, Tom?

22
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Soon.

23
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:05.542 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And who’s cooking it?

24
00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
We are.

25
00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Tom’s dad
is just finishing it for us.

26
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Your dad's here? Oh, he’s great.

27
00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:22.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
- Come on, let’s go say hi.
- Uh, that’s not a good idea.

28
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:26.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
What? Why not? Come on, Ellie.

29
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.042 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hi, Mr Roberts.

30
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, hello, you two. How are you?

31
00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.708 A:middle L:100% S:80%
We’re fine. How are you?

32
00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:51.375 A:middle L:100% S:80%
I'm wonderful. And...
Oh, I’ll get that.

33
00:02:55.542 --> 00:03:00.000 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Hey, this looks ready now.
Can we eat it?

34
00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:02.833 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Umm, uh...

35
00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on. Let’s get some plates.

36
00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Do you want some help?

37
00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Yes, please.

38
00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:25.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Mm, this pizza looks so good.

39
00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.333 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Ruby, wait, ...

40
00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:35.500 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Mmmm, really good. You’re right, Tom -
you make great pizza.

41
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:40.125 A:middle L:100% S:80%
But, Ruby, there’s cheese on the pizza,
and you hate cheese!

42
00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:46.458 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Well, yes, you’re right.
I don’t like cheese very much,

43
00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.292 A:middle L:100% S:80%
but on pizza - yum!

44
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:53.583 A:middle L:100% S:80%
And there isn’t much cheese
on it. It’s just right!

45
00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.167 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Come on, boys. We can’t eat it all.

46
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.792 A:middle L:100% S:80%
OK! Great!

47
00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.958 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Give me a slice!

48
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:01.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Delicious!

49
00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:02.875 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Thanks, guys.

50
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.250 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Here we are! Who wants chicken?

51
00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.417 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Chicken, too?! Yum!

52
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.667 A:middle L:100% S:80%
Oh, I’d like a piece of chicken!

53
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.750 A:middle L:100% S:80%
This looks great.
